CamelPing
=========

Illustrates a contrived example of using Camel route to poll an endpoint and post process 
the results in a custom processor exposed via JMX. 

Invoke as follows:
CamelPing -url <url to poll> -period <period of polling in ms> -delay <initial delay in ms>

eg. To monitor Spring 'petclinic' sample:

```
CamelPing -url http://localhost:8080/petclinic -period 10000 -delay 0
